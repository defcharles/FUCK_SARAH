# FUCK_SARAH

I was recently denied access to 24 GS by Sarah, who explicitly stated that her reason was because I am Black. This is a deeply offensive and discriminatory action, and I take it very seriously.

In addition to this racist behavior, Sarah also skidded (stole or cloned) the full S24 GS from Magma without permission. This is a clear violation of intellectual property and an act of digital theft.

I am documenting everything and will be reporting this to the local authorities for further investigation. Discrimination and cybercrime are both serious offenses, and I will not tolerate either.
